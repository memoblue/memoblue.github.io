Just a little Jekyll powered blog to keep track of the stuff I come across as I'm learning how to code and stuff. The reason why I decided to write this blog can be found there on the [Recurse Center User's Manual][1].

If you need to contact me, feel free to use the email in the footer, but you'll need to replace the "my website" and "url" parts with the actual URL of my website of courseâ€¦ I just want to make sure you're not a bot ;)

Thanks!
