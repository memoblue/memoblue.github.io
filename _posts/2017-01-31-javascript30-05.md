Notes on the [5th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Flex Gallery.

## Flex Gallery

This lesson was surprisingly low on JavaScript. I didn't really learn anything new, but I did get to use the `transitionend` event listener some more, which is pretty much the main purpose of this course: practice. And the project, even though mostly `CSS` based was pretty cool.

Another good reminder: using `includes()` on strings in conditional:

```js
if(e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
  this.classList.toggle('my-class');
}
```
