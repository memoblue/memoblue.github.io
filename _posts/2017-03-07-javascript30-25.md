Notes on the [25th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Event Bubbling.

I really liked that one. We didn't build anything fancy, but we went into the details of how JavaScript works.

I knew about event bubbling, but in typical Wes Bos fashion, he makes it easier to understand and remember key concepts using a short video instead of your typical lengthy blog post.

The gist of it is that an event will first "capture", going down the DOM, and then "bubble" back up.

When you setup up an event handler, you can pass it a config object that lets you set 2 optional options:

```js
el.addEventListener('click', logText, {
  capture: false, // Default. If `true` the click is triggered on the way down
  once: true // removes the event handler after it's been triggered once
});
```

There's also `stopPropagation()` which will stop even bubbling/capturing after the event is triggered.

```js
function doIt(e) {
  // do something…
  e.stopPropagation();
}
```
