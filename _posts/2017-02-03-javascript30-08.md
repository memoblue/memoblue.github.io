Notes on the [8th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Canvas Drawing.

## Canvas Drawing

This lesson was a good intro to `canvas`, even though the actual project was more fun than practical.

It wouldn't be very useful to list code snippets from this particular example. They wouldn't be reusable. Instead, I'll list a few resources about `canvas` that should come in handy when I get a chance to look more into it:

* [Canvas on MDN][mdn]
* [Learn HTML5 Graphics and Animation][egghead]
* [html5canvastutorials.com][html5canvastutorials]
* [Gorgeous demo][medusae]
