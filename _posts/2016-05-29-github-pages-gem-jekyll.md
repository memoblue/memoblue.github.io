The [Jekyll docs][1] say that if you host your site on GitHub, you should use the `github-pages` gem to manage Jekyll's dependencies so when you deploy your site to GitHub, your local gem versions will be in sync with the ones currently on GitHub Pages.

But when I installed that gem, it totally broke my Jekyll install. It wouldn't build anymore. Instead, I got a not so helpful error: "Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don't have kramdown or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyllâ€¦"

After a bunch of Googling, I came to the conclusion that if I installed [rbenv][2] instead of using the system's ruby version, the problem would most likely go away.

I already had [Homebrew][3] on my Mac, so I used it to install `rbenv`, just following the instructions in the readme. The only part that tripped me up for a bit was my `~/.bash_profile` setup. I had to add this to it:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

I also kept my gem file much simpler than in the docs:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# bundle update github-pages
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
```

Now everything is back to normal and Jekyll is working again :)
