Notes on the [6th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30] created by Wes Bos.

## Type Ahead

This lesson was packed with good stuff, but the highlights were:

1. The [`fetch`][fetch] API to load stuff asynchronously
2. [`RegExp`][regexp] objects used in conjunction with `replace()` for some cool string manipulations
3. An easy way to return a subset of data stored in an array with `filter()`

I think it's easier to refer to the [source code directly][git] than excerpt for this lesson.
