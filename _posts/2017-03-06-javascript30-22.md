Notes on the [22nd lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Follow on Hover.

I watched lessons 20 and 21. They were great. But I won't have a use for them any time soon so I'm skipping them on here.

Lesson 22 though is a great "how to" for a common effect where a UI element follows the mouse on hover. It's possible to get this effect with just CSS in simple nav bars, but it's still interesting to see how it's done via JavaScript.

The main idea in this exercise is to get the position and dimensions of the element you're hovering with the `getBoundingClientRect()` method, and then apply the same values to the "following" element.

[My code][git] is a little different than Wes' because I use [destructuring assignment][mdn] instead of storing my variables in an object. But otherwise, I'm using his technic.
