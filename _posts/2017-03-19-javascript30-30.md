Notes on the [30th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Wack a Mole.

Creating a game is a fun way to synthesize everything you've learned, and this lesson was a great way to end the series.

It goes over another use of the maths to get a range:

```js
function randomTime(min, max) {
  return Math.round((Math.random() * (max - min)) + min);
}
```

It has a couple of use cases for recursive functions, `DOM` manipulation, and event handler. And it has a neet little trick to make sure clicks are from real users:

```js
if (!e.isTrusted) return; // not a real click
```

Overall, this course is a great way to get experience building stuff. It demystifies some of the more intimidating aspects of `DOM` interactions and events. And after going through 30 exercises, I feel much more confident about my abilities to build whatever I can come up with.
