Notes on the [19th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Webcam Fun.

This one is a crazy lesson where I got to play with my computer webcam for the first time ever! From `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`, to `ctx.getImageData()` and `ctx.putImageData()`… It's too much to cover in a blog post and easier to just look at the code [linked above][git].

The one tip I want to save here is setting up a local server with [Browsersync][bs]. The [package file][npm] for that is tiny and it's so easy to use! I knew you could sync browsers during development with, but I didn't realize it had its own built in server. For quick local dev, it's awesome!
