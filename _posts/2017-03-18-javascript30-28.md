Notes on the [28th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Video Speed Controller.

I learned about the `toFixed()` method, which returns a string representing a rounded value with the number of decimals specified as an argument:

```js
(1.3244).toFixed(2); // '1.32'
(1.347).toFixed(2); // '1.35'
(1.3).toFixed(2); // '1.30'
```

The rest was more about maths. A good tip was how to setup a slider with a custom range (from `0.4` to `4` for instance):

```js
const min = 0.4;
const max = 4;
const percent = e.offsetY / speed.offsetHeight;
const ratio = percent * (max - min) + min;
```
