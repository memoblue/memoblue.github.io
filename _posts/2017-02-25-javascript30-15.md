Notes on the [15th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: locaStorage.

Pretty sweet lesson with an intro to `localStorage` as well as a few neat tricks.

### Easy Custom CSS checkboxes

```html
<style>
p input {
  display: none;
}

p label {
  cursor: pointer;
}

p label:before {
  content: '⬜️';
  margin-right: 10px;
}

p input:checked + label:before { /* check/uncheck works because for='' on <label> */
  content: '🏃🏻';
}
</style>
<p>
  <input type="checkbox" id="toggle">
  <label for="toggle">toggle</label>
</p>
```

### localStorage

It's as easy as

* `localStorage.setItem('key', value)`
* `localStorage.getItem('key')`

But since everything is stored in `JSON`, the way to sync data looks more like:

```js
const myVar = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('item')) || '';
localStorage.setItem('item', JSON.stringify(myVar));
```

When trying to sync `localStorage` with the DOM, it becomes pretty clear why something like React/Redux is the way to go.

### Other

The use of `matches()` makes it trivial to filter out the event you don't want in event delegations:

```js
function myFunc(e) {
  if (!e.target.matches('input')) return; // skip if it's not on the element you want
  // etc...
}
```
