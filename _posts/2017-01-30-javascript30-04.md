Notes on the [4th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30] created by Wes Bos.

## Array Cardio Day 1

I didn't learn as much as in the other lessons because I already worked on most [array methods before][methods], but I still picked up a couple of cool tricks (even though not directly related to arrays).

You can use the spread operator to convert a NodeList to an array on the fly, if you need for instance to use `map()` on it:

```js
const text = [...document.querySelectorAll('.my-class a')].map(a => a.textContent);
```

I always used `previous` and `next` as mental model for the `reduce()` method arguments, but this example really helped me thinking about it in a more flexible way:

```js
const data = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'truck', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'car', 'truck' ];

const summary = data.reduce((obj, item) => {
  if(!obj[item]) {
    obj[item] =  0;
  }
  obj[item]++;
  return obj;
}, {});

console.log(summary); // {car: 5, truck: 3, bike: 2, walk: 2, van: 2}
```
