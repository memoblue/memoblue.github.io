Notes on the [29th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Countdown.

This lesson was a great way to utilize a bunch of the technics learned throughout the course. I also learned a little more about the `Date()` object:

```js
const t = new Date(timestamp);
const hour = t.getHours();
const minutes = t.getMinutes();
```

An easy way to customize the `<title>`:

```js
// changing a browser tabs title is trivial!
document.title = 'whoops!';
```

And an easy way to select form/input DOM elements:

```js
// access any element that has a `name` attribute directly.
document.myForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {} // name="myForm"
```
