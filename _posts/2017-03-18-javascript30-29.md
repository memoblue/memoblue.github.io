Notes on the [29th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Countdown.

This lesson was a great way to utilize a bunch of the technics learned throughout the course. I also learned a little more about the `Date()` object, and an easy way to hook into the DOM:

```js
// changing a browser tabs title is trivial!
document.title = 'whoops!';

// you can access any element that has a `name` attribute directly.
document.customForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) { // name="customForm"
```
