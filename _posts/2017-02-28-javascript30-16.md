Notes on the [16th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: mousemove.

A fun little lesson where we change CSS properties based on the mouse position. The most useful tips in order to achieve that:

### Account for nested elements

When you use the `mousemove` event listener, since the event's `x` and `y` coordinates will be *relative* to the current element you're mousing over, not necessarily the element the event is attached to, you can use something like that to ignore all elements but the one you're interested in:

```js
function moving(e) {
    let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e; // destructuring and assignment one liner!
    if (this !== e.target) {
        x = x + e.target.offsetLeft;
        y = y + e.target.offsetTop;
    }
}

el.addEventListener('mousemove', moving);
```

The rest of the lesson is mostly about DOM related properties, and a bit a math to get the right scale between the mouse coordinates and the CSS effect:

* `offsetX`
* `offsetY`
* `offsetWidth`
* `offsetHeight`
* `offsetLeft`
* `offsetTop`

We divide the current position `x` by the total `width` to get a "percentage" from 0 to 1. We then multiply it by what Wes calls the "walk" which is basically the scale of the effect. Then we remove half of that "walk" from the total so we get a `-50`–`50` range.

```js
const walk = 100;
const { offsetWidth: width, offsetHeight: height } = hero;
let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e;
// ...
Math.round((x / width * walk) - (walk / 2));
Math.round((y / height * walk) - (walk / 2));
```
