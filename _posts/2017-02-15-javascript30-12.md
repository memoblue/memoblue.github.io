Notes on the [12th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Key sequence.

This short lesson featured an interesting use of the `splice()` method in order to code essentially a key logger. I ended up using `shift()` instead though, since it seem to be the perfect use cases.

Here's how you'd keep the last 10 keys a user presses in an array:

```js
let pressed = [];
window.addEventListener('keyup', e => {
    pressed.push(e.key);
    pressed.length > 10 ? pressed.shift() : '';
});
```
