Notes on the [3rd lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30] created by Wes Bos.

## CSS Variables

The main takeaway is that CSS variables are really easy to manipulate with JavaScript. It's a 2 part process. First you setup your variables in the CSS:

```scss
:root {
    --spacing: 10px;
}
.my-class {
    border: var(--spacing);
}
```

Then modifying them via JavaScript's `style.setProperty()` is trivial:

```js
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--spacing', '20px');
```

I also got to play with 2 really cool `input` types I knew existed but never really used:

```html
<input type="range" min="10" max="200" value="10">
<input type="color" value="#ffc600">
```

I also got to use 2 different event listeners: `change` and `mousemove`.
