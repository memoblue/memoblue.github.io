Notes on the [26th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Follow Along Nav.

What a great lesson! When I first saw the Stripe website redesign, their "following" drop downs intrigued me as well. Once you know how to do it, it's actually not that complicated. Just calculate the size and position of the drop down and apply it to the sliding element. That's about it really…

One cool little trick was on how to deal with the `setTimeout` and rapid user interactions (the syntax using the `&&` operator as a conditional was pretty cool too):

```js
setTimeout(() => this.classList.contains('trigger-enter') && this.classList.add('trigger-enter-active'), 50);
```
