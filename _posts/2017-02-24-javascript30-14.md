Notes on the [14th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Copy vs. Reference.

This lesson basically details how to go around the way JavaScript stores objects and arrays by reference in variables. Unfortunately, Wes never stops to explain why JavaScript works that way. Here's a pretty clean overview I found on [Stack Overflow][so]:

JavaScript has 6 primitive data types:

* string
* number
* boolean
* null
* undefined
* symbol (ES6)

With the exception of `null` and `undefined`, all primitives values have object equivalents which wrap around the primitive values (e.g. a `String` object wraps around a string primitive. Primitives are immutable values, they have no properties. They are stored in the location that the variable accesses.

Objects are aggregations of properties. A property can reference an object or a primitive. They are stored by reference. A reference is a pointer to a location in memory where the object is stored.

When you assign a primitive to a variable, its value is copied into it, but when you assign an array/object to a variable, a reference to that original array/object is passed to the variable:

```js
// primitives are copied
let name = 'memo';
let name2 = name;
name2 = 'blue';
console.log(name, name2); // memo blue

// objects are referenced
const players = ['Rollins', 'Coltrane'];
const musicians = players;
musicians.push('Shorter');
console.log(players); // ["Rollins", "Coltrane", "Shorter"]
console.log(musicians); // ["Rollins", "Coltrane", "Shorter"]
```

That's really where the lesson starts… Wes gives us a few tricks to copy objects/arrays instead of passing them by reference them:

### Copy an array

Here are 4 easy ways to make a copy of an array (best first):

```js
const players = ['Rollins', 'Coltrane'];
// copy array in a new variable
const team3 = [...players]; // ES6
const team4 = Array.from(players);
const team2 = [].concat(players);
const team1 = players.slice();
```

### Copy an object

```js
const player = {
  name: 'Sonny',
  instrument: 'sax'
};
// shallow copy
const player2 = Object.assign({}, player, { name: 'Coltrane' });
// Deep copy (ES6 - not supported in browsers yet)
const player3 = {...player}
// Deep copy trick (not a production ready performant solution)
const player4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(player));
```
