Notes on the [1st lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30] created by Wes Bos.

## JavaScript Drum Kit

The API for `<audio />` seems much easier to use than I would have thought:

```js
const audio = document.querySelector('audio');
audio.play();
```

You can easily interact with the keyboard with the `keydown` event and the `keyCode` property:

```js
const doSomething = (e) => {
    console.log(e.keyCode);
}
window.addEventListener('keydown', doSomething);
```

You can hook into CSS animation with event handlers like `transitionend`.

```js
el.addEventListener('transitionend', doSomething);
```

We really don't need jQuery to manipulate classes anymore:

```js
const myEl = document.querySelector('.my-class');
myEl.classList.add('another-class');
myEl.classList.remove('my-class');
myEl.classList.toggle('my-class');
```

`forEach` now works on NodeList elements:

```js
const myList = document.querySelectorAll('li');
myList.forEach(myLi => myLi.classList.add('my-class'));
```
