Notes on the [10th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Hold Shift (there was nothing really useful in the 9th lesson so I'm skipping it).

## Hold Shift

Wes starts the lesson off by saying we should try to complete it ourself. Being pretty stubborn, I ended up doing the whole thing. So I didn't learn a bunch of brand new things, but I got some practice instead. Still worth it. I actually prefer the solution I came up with (his is a bit buggy actually). I did learn a couple minor things.

You can use `shiftKey` on an event to know if the shift key is down:

```js
function doSomething(e) {
    if(e.shiftKey) {
        // do something while shift is down
    }
}
```

You can use the `click` even listener on checkboxes. It doesn't have to be `change`.
