Now that CSS Grid Layout has landed in Safari, it's [supported in all major browser][caniuse] (beside IE… If you still consider that a "major" browser) so it's time to start learning how it works.

CSS Grid Layout is pure awesomeness. I'd say it's the greatest thing that happened to CSS since… CSS. This is how I learned CSS Grid Layout, and it worked out pretty nicely:

* I read through the [Webkit blog post][1] for an overview (10mn)
* I delve into the specifics with the [CSS Tricks article][2] (20mn)
* I checked out a [bunch of examples][3] on Rachel Andrew's site (1h30mn)
* <del>I wasted my time on [egghead.io][4] free course</del> (1h - I'd skip that one)

And most importantly, I messed around on [codepen][codepen] and created a bunch of grids to really get the hang of it.

If you haven't looked into CSS grids yet, _do it!_ It's amazing… and fun.
