Notes on the [24th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Sticky Nav.

I watched lesson 23, but just like 20 and 21, I won't have a use for it (Speech Synthesis) any time soon so I'm skipping the recap.

A sticky nav is really common and pretty basic at this stage. I think it would have been better to cover it earlier in the course… The only thing to note for me was that we're using `el.offsetTop` and `el.offsetHeight`, and not `getBoundingClientRect()` like in [lesson 22][22];

According to [MDN][mdn], it looks like stuff like [offsetTop][mdn] is relative to its closest **positioned** parent whereas [getBoundingClientRect()][mdn2] is relative to the viewport.
