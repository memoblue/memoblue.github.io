Notes on the [27th lesson][git] in the [javascript30 Challenge][js30]: Click and Drag.

Another great lesson that demystifies what can feel like voodoo magic at first but turns out to be pretty simple once you understand what event listeners and properties are involved. Here's what you need for "click and drag":

### Event listeners

* `mousedown`
* `mouseup`
* `mousemove`
* `mouseleave`

### Properties

* `el.offsetLeft`
* `el.scrollLeft`
* `event.pageX`

That's it!

Then, the basic logic is actually pretty straightforward:

1. Store initial `mousedown` coordinates and `scrollLeft` value
2. Update current mouse coordinates on `mousemove`
3. Calculate the difference between the current and initial mouse coordinates
4. Deduct that result from the current `scrollLeft`
5. Done!

There a few more important details in the [code implementation][git], like tracking the state of the mouse down across the different event listeners with a `isDown` variable, or making sure no text gets selected by accident with a `e.preventDefault()`. But after this lesson, coding up more complex UI interactions seems a lot more approachable.

Thanks Wes!
